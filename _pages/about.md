I have put together this website as a single-location to find research, data, code, analysis and relevant links for my different projects and interests. Broadly these include: data, weather, sports, analysis, programming, automation, web development.

This site is currently under development, with more content being added over the coming days and weeks.

My other websites:

[Stumped!](http://www.stumpedgame.com) - A multiplayer, online cricket-management game.  
[RainSoon](http://www.rainsoon.co.uk) - Probabilistic weather forecasts for the UK, based on post-processing Met Office forecasts.
